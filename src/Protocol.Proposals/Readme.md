# LSP Proposals
Any types that are in this assembly are subject to addition or removal at any time as the [spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-17/#version_3_17_0) itself evolves.

We strive to have the most up to date feature set for C# against the LSP spec, so sometimes that means things will break in this assembly. The goal is for this assembly to evolve and the protocol assembles to stay largerly untouched from breaking changes, as much as is possible.
